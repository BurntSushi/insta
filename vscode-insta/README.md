# insta

This extension adds syntax highlighting for [insta](https://crates.io/crates/insta) snapshot files.

## Features

After loading the extension `.snap` snapshots from insta are picked up automatically
and syntax highlighted as if they are YAML files.  For RON snapshots some small
tweaks are applied.
